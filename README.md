# Portfolio website using React.js

This project is my personal website/portfolio. It was made using React and Redux. Visit the site at [www.rachelrosefigura.com](http://www.rachelrosefigura.com).

If you are interested in building a portfolio website with React, you can use the template [here](https://github.com/react-portfolio/react-portfolio). My portfolio builds off of the template by implementing React router to handle multiple pages and displays the projects on a carousel instead of on one infinitely scrolling page. 

## Development

In the project's directory, run the following commands:

```
$ npm install
$ npm run dev
```

This will start webpack-dev-server and enable hot reloading. Then  visit:

```
http://localhost:3000
```
